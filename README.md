# Prime Group Project - Hero K9

Hero K9 is a new, national, non-profit organization focused on maintaining the safety and well-being of K9s in law enforcement. They work to connect available grants with certified K9s in order to provide them with life-saving equipment.

This full stack JavaScript-based web application allows users to inquire about obtaining funding for in-squad kennels, stab proof vests, bulletproof vests, and/or door pop/heat alarm devices. An authorized signer completes the master account application for a given police department, and indicates which equipment is being requested for each K9 in the department. Once the account has been approved by an admin from Hero K9, the master account holder signs the legal agreement, and then each K9 handler has the ability to create an account for their K9. The grant approval process is completed when the equipment has been shipped to the police department.
